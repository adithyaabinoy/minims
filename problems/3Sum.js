/* 3 sum is a question where we have to find the 3 elements with the given sum .
step 1 : We are going to run nested for loops and the loop will be starting from i =0; for the first one and for the second its going to start from j = i +1 and for the last loop it will be k = j + 1;
step 2 : we will use conditions to match the sum with sum of 3 elements */
